# Week 7- Technigo Bootcamp

# Project GitHub Tracker

This week, we want you to create a place to keep track of the GitHub repos that you're using here at Technigo. You will continue practicing your JavaScript and API skills with the help of GitHub's own documentation.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
